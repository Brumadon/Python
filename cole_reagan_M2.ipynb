    "Being that the data only represents three months out of the summer, a fairly common indicator of the higher month in July is the Holiday sale(s). While both June and August contain national holidays, July 4th is a big retail holiday sale that usually encompasses the weekend pre and post as well. This may be the largest indicator of the higher average revenue in July. Averages are more prone to outliers like large pieces than the mean would be. For example, with the given instruction, June has a smaller time period than the other two months- meaning the month of June has less of a chance for a large piece of data, i.e. a large bump of revenue."

    "I would recommend having more sales driven by time periods of the year. While many retailers across the nation all strive for the big Holiday deals (such as July 4th, Labor Day, Memorial Day, tax-free weekend, etc.) ASOS could have independent Holiday deals that are accessible both in-store and online. Also, given that US-based companies are offering more, or at least maintaining, the number of paid holidays - according to Management Research Association (MRA) 2023 Holiday Practices Survey-, in-store specific sales may be a big driving factor for even larger discounts than those seen online. Again, I would recommend increases the number of store Holiday deals, possibly even being the driving force behind more retailers following more Holidays for sales."
