    "# Introduction\n",
    "For this Milestone, you’re joining the New York City Department of Education as a data analyst intern. Your first assignment is to explore a dataset containing recent information on NYC public high schools, including enrollment numbers, demographics, and socioeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to better understand the landscape of public high school education in NYC by analyzing key metrics such as total enrollment, percentage of students with disabilities, English learners, and students living in poverty. By visualizing these variables and investigating potential relationships between them, you’ll help uncover patterns and raise important questions that could inform future policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work here lays the foundation for data-driven improvements in educational equity, resource allocation, and student support across the city’s schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, import both the pandas library and the plotly.express library."
