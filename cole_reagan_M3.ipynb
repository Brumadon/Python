    "A different approach is to use **accumulator** variables. An accumulator variable is a variable that is modified in each iteration of the loop. For example, if you are storing the number of students for each university, outside of the loop you will define `n_students = 0` but within the loop you will increment the value of `n_students` for every university that matches your criteria. Incrementing and assigning back to the same variable can be done with the `+=` operator.\n",

    "Being that the athletic department is made up of athletes (quite redundant), data could be pulled showing the mean school major or degree plan of the top athletes. While we narrowed it down to the \"Big 12\" conference, the data is already there for multiple schools. It would be suggested to get a list of the top 25% of athletes (based on statistics of player performance), and find out what their major was. For example, if a player elects to have a degree plan of psychology, but a particular university doesn't even offer that degree plan, it would eliminate the school as a choice for the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The athletic department could also focus on funding for its athletic scholarships. Data like what funds are available, how to improve alumni participation and sponsorship, and the amount of private donations should be analyzed. This is because most of the top high school footbal players are 'recruited' or at least aware of what school they would like to attend. School attendance and choice is largely based on culture. So, for example, if a school in Kansas can make a very appealing scholarship offer to a student in Austin, TX, like a full-ride scholarship based on player performance, you may just influence the student to attend your school in Kansas instead of UT in Austin."
